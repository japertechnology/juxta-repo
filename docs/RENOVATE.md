# Renovate Configuration

This repository uses [Renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate) to keep
dependencies up to date across all organisation repositories. The shared
configuration lives in [`.github/renovate.json`](../.github/renovate.json).

Run `npx renovate` locally or trigger the appropriate workflow manually to
generate dependency update pull requests.
