# List of **differences** between *versions of Galaga*

## Arcade Original (1981, Namco / Midway)

* **Authentic arcade gameplay**: exact original enemy patterns, sprite speed, and single‑screen layout.
* **Bonuses and kill‑screen at level 255**: after stage 255 the game resets or exhibits erratic behavior depending on DIP switch settings (the so‑called "kill screen") ([GameFAQs][1], [Wikipedia][2]).

## SG‑1000 / Sega‑Galaga (1983)

* **Based on Sord M5 version** with only minor changes.
* **Added scrolling background** and a new title screen with instruction info—not in arcade original.
* Lacks high‑score table and **Challenging bonus stages** present in arcade ([namco.fandom.com][3]).

## Sord M5 ("Galax", 1982) & PV‑2000 (1983)

* **Simplified port** lacking bonus stages and high‑score table.
* PV‑2000 version is nearly identical to Sord M5 except for name change.
  ([namco.fandom.com][3]).

## MSX (1984)

* **Restored challenging bonus stages and “dual fighter” gameplay** like arcade.
* Still **no high‑score table**.
* Graphics and sound still simplified relative to arcade.
  ([namco.fandom.com][3], [Wikipedia][4], [GameFAQs][1]).

## Famicom / NES – *Galaga: Demons of Death* (1985/1988)

* **Includes bonus stages and dual‑fighter rescue feature**, similar to MSX.
* **Improved graphics** more faithful to arcade than MSX.
* **Still no high‑score table** in‑game.
* Some online re‑releases mirror this port when included in Virtual Console or compilations ([namco.fandom.com][3], [Wikipedia][2]).

## Atari 7800 (Launch title)

* **Highly arcade‑faithful**; regarded as one of the closest home ports of the era.
* Some **differences in ramping difficulty and color palette**, depending on system limitations.
* **Bonus stages and dual‑fighter included**, but minor speed/resolution differences.
  ([Gaming History 101][5], [namco.fandom.com][3]).

## Xbox Live Arcade (2006)

* **Very accurate reproduction of arcade code**, including enemy timing, sounds, and levels.
* **Bonus**: supports **achievement system and online leaderboards**.
* **Fixed the stage‑overflow kill screen** bug: gameplay continues past level 255 (score wraps to "HERO A" etc.) ([Wikipedia][2], [StrategyWiki][6]).

## Arcade Archives / Arcade Game Series (PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC)

* Includes both Japanese “Old” and “Final” ROM versions (based on Namco release).
* **Graphical branding differences**: "©1981 NAMCO LTD." vs. Midway as applicable.
* Otherwise **emulation is nearly identical to arcade original**.
  ([shmups.system11.org][7], [Steam Community][8]).

These statements emphasize **definitive feature differences** across key ports—ideal for AI-driven decision-making or selecting a target baseline. Let me know if you want this broken down further (e.g. Game Boy, mobile, GBA etc.), or in another format.
