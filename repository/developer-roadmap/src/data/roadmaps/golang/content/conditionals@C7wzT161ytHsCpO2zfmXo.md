# Conditionals

Control program flow based on conditions. `if` for basic logic, `if-else` for binary decisions, `switch` for multiple conditions. `if` supports optional initialization, no parentheses needed but braces required. `switch` supports expressions, type switches, fallthrough. Fundamental for business logic.
