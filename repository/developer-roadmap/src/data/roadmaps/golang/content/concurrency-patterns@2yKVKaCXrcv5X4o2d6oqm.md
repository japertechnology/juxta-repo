# Concurrency Patterns

Established design approaches for structuring concurrent programs using goroutines and channels. Key patterns: fan-in (merging inputs), fan-out (distributing work), pipelines (chaining operations), worker pools, pub-sub communication. Help build efficient, scalable apps while avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
