# Modules & Dependencies

Go modules are the dependency management system introduced in Go 1.11. Define module with `go.mod` file containing module path and dependencies. Use `go get` to add dependencies, `go mod tidy` to clean up. Supports semantic versioning and replacement directives. Essential for modern Go development.
