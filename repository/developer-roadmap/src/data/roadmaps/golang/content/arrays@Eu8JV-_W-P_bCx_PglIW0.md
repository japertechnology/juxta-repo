# Arrays

Fixed-size sequences of same-type elements. Size is part of the type, so different sizes are different types. Declared with specific length, initialized to zero values. Value types (copied when assigned/passed). Slices are more commonly used due to flexibility. Foundation for understanding Go's type system.
